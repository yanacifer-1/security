CS student project: Secure File Store
===============================================
My Code is in `client.py`.
This project requires to design and implement a secure file sharing system in Python. Imagine something
like Dropbox, but secured with cryptography so that the server cannot see or tamper your data.

Environment: Python 3 and PyCrypto 2.6.1 (or later) 

Base Client, Server code and test code are provided. All code for Crypto from CS161 Project 2: https://cs161.org/assets/projects/2/project2-spec.pdf
